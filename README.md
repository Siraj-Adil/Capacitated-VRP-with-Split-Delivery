# Capacitated-VRP-with-Split-Delivery (CSDVRP)
This project is about Solving a Capacitated VRP with Split Delivery for 9 locations spread across Varanasi City.
## VRP
The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem which asks "What is the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers?" It generalises the travelling salesman problem (TSP). It first appeared in a paper by George Dantzig and John Ramser in 1959,
## Capacitated Split Delivery (CSDVRP)
Split Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (SDVRP) is a variant of the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) where each customer can receive goods from more than one vehicle, and each vehicle can serve multiple customers. In SDVRP, the objective is to minimize the total travel cost or distance traveled by all vehicles while ensuring that each customer's demand is satisfied.

The "split delivery" aspect of the problem refers to the fact that each customer can receive goods from multiple vehicles, which can be a more efficient way of serving customers than having one vehicle make multiple trips to the same customer.

SDVRP is a complex optimization problem with a wide range of real-world applications, such as logistics and transportation planning, waste collection, and emergency services. To solve SDVRP, various algorithms and techniques have been proposed, such as heuristics, meta-heuristics, and exact algorithms.
